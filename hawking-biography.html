          <h3>1942: Birth in Oxford During WWII</h3>
          <p>Born January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England—exactly 300 years after Galileo's death. His birth during WWII came as his parents sought refuge from London's German bombing campaigns.</p>

            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> Stephen William Hawking entered the world in wartime Britain. His father, Frank, was a medical researcher specializing in tropical diseases; his mother, Isobel, was one of Oxford's first female graduates and a political activist.</p>
            <p>The Hawking household was famously eccentric. Family dinners were silent affairs where everyone read books. They drove around in an old London taxi because it was affordable and practical. The house had no central heating, and bees lived in the basement.</p>
            <p>Growing up in St. Albans, young Stephen was curious but not academically exceptional initially. His handwriting was terrible, and his teachers noted he was bright but disorganized. Classmates nicknamed him "Einstein" as a joke—prophetically, it turned out.</p>

          <h3>1959-1962: Oxford University Years</h3>
          <p>Entered Oxford at 17 to study physics. Despite exceptional talent, he was bored and spent only an hour per day studying, yet still achieved first-class honors.</p>

          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> Hawking later estimated he worked only 1,000 hours during three years at Oxford—roughly an hour daily. The work was too easy for his brilliant mind. He was more interested in socializing and being "one of the boys."</p>
            <p>He joined the rowing club as a coxswain (the person who steers and coordinates the crew). This was one of the few sports his slight build suited. He was popular and known for his wit and daring personality, once steering a boat directly toward a bridge to force the crew to row faster.</p>
            <p>During his final year, disturbing symptoms emerged: clumsiness, frequent falls, slurred speech. He dismissed these signs as products of excessive drinking and late nights. The truth would prove far more serious.</p>

          <h3>1963: The Devastating ALS Diagnosis</h3>
          <p>At 21, shortly after beginning his PhD at Cambridge, Hawking was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Doctors gave him 2-3 years to live.</p>
          <button class="detail-toggle" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Read Detailed Analysis</button>
          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> The diagnosis shattered his world. Hawking fell into deep depression: "Before my condition was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing."</p>
            <p>In the hospital, a pivotal moment occurred. He saw a boy dying of leukemia in the bed opposite. "Whenever I feel inclined to be sorry for myself I remember that boy," he later said. His perspective shifted—things could be worse.</p>
            <p>Then he met Jane Wilde at a New Year's party. Her love and commitment gave him purpose: "The engagement changed my life. It gave me something to live for." Her decision to marry him, knowing his terminal diagnosis, was an extraordinary act of love.</p>
            <p>Defying expectations, his disease progressed slowly. He threw himself into research with newfound intensity. The threat of early death focused his mind like never before.</p>

          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> Jane was 23, studying languages, when they married. She became wife, caregiver, mother, and intellectual partner. Their relationship was complex—filled with love, strain, devotion, and eventually, separation after 25 years.</p>
            <p>His PhD thesis applied singularity theorems to the universe's origin, proving the Big Bang began with a singularity. The work demonstrated mathematical brilliance and creative physical intuition. In 2017, Cambridge made the thesis freely available online—it crashed their servers from overwhelming demand.</p>
            <p>They had three children: Robert (1967), Lucy (1970), and Timothy (1979). Jane described the challenges of raising children while caring for Stephen and pursuing her own PhD. The physical and emotional toll was immense, yet she persevered with remarkable strength.</p>

          <h3>1974: Discovery of Hawking Radiation</h3>
          <p>Revolutionary discovery: black holes aren't completely black—they emit radiation due to quantum effects. This unified quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics.</p>
          <button class="detail-toggle" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Read Detailed Analysis</button>
          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> When Hawking presented this at a 1974 conference, the reaction was stunned disbelief. Chairman John Taylor apologized to the audience, thinking Hawking had embarrassed himself. The greatest minds in physics thought he was wrong.</p>
            <p>But he wasn't. The calculation showed that quantum effects near black hole event horizons create particle-antiparticle pairs. One falls into the black hole; the other escapes as radiation. Over eons, black holes evaporate completely.</p>
            <p>This discovery connected three fundamental physics pillars: gravity (general relativity), quantum mechanics (particle physics), and thermodynamics (entropy and temperature). It proved black holes have temperature and entropy—properties previously thought impossible.</p>
            <p>At 32, Hawking became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society. The phenomenon was named "Hawking radiation," ensuring his place in physics history alongside Newton and Einstein.</p>

          <h3>1979: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</h3>
          <p>Appointed to Newton's former chair—the Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge. At 37, he was among the youngest ever to receive this honor.</p>
          <button class="detail-toggle" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Read Detailed Analysis</button>
          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> The Lucasian Professorship, established in 1663, is among the world's most prestigious academic positions. Previous holders include Isaac Newton (1669), Charles Babbage (1828), and Paul Dirac (1932).</p>
            <p>His inaugural lecture boldly predicted: "Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?" He optimistically suggested a complete unified theory might emerge within 20 years. This proved premature, but reflected his ambitious vision.</p>
            <p>By this time, Hawking used a wheelchair and his speech was severely impaired. Most of his communication came through painstaking spelling on letter boards. Yet his intellectual output remained prodigious—publishing papers, mentoring students, and advancing cosmology's frontiers.</p>

          <h3>1985: Loss of Speech & The Iconic Voice</h3>
          <p>Life-threatening pneumonia required a tracheostomy, ending his ability to speak. He began using a voice synthesizer that became his iconic identity.</p>
          <button class="detail-toggle" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Read Detailed Analysis</button>
          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> While visiting CERN in Switzerland, Hawking contracted severe pneumonia. Doctors suggested turning off life support. Jane refused adamantly, insisting he be flown to Cambridge for treatment. The tracheostomy saved his life but silenced his voice forever.</p>
            <p>Computer scientist Walt Woltosz provided software called "Equalizer," allowing word selection from a screen. A speech synthesizer (Speech Plus) gave him a voice—with a distinctive American accent.</p>
            <p>Hawking joked: "The only trouble is that it gives me an American accent." Over years, he was offered more natural-sounding voices but refused: "This voice has become my identity."</p>
            <p>Eventually, he controlled the system with a single cheek muscle—the last he could voluntarily move. Composing a single sentence took minutes. Yet he continued lecturing worldwide, writing books, and participating in debates with remarkable effectiveness.</p>
            <p>This voice became globally recognizable, featured in TV shows, documentaries, and even Pink Floyd songs. It WAS Hawking.</p>

          <h3>1988: "A Brief History of Time"</h3>
          <p>Published his masterpiece making cosmology accessible to millions. It stayed on the Sunday Times bestseller list for 237 weeks and sold over 25 million copies.</p>
          <button class="detail-toggle" onclick="toggleDetail(this)">Read Detailed Analysis</button>
          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> Hawking wrote this to explain the universe to non-scientists. His publisher warned: each equation halves sales. So he included only E=mc². The book covers black holes, the Big Bang, time's nature, and unified theories.</p>
            <p>Writing was painstaking. Using his synthesizer, Hawking composed word-by-word. Editor Peter Guzzardi sent dozens of queries demanding clarifications. The result: scientifically accurate yet readable.</p>
            <p>The book became a cultural phenomenon. It sold 25 million copies in 40 languages, spending over four years on bestseller lists. Critics joked it was "the most unread bestseller"—many bought it but found it challenging. Still, it inspired millions and made Hawking a global celebrity.</p>
            <p>The book transformed his life from respected physicist to international icon. He appeared on TV shows (The Simpsons, Star Trek, The Big Bang Theory), gave lectures to packed auditoriums, and became synonymous with genius itself.</p>
            <p>Yet fame brought challenges. Media demands were relentless. Privacy vanished. But Hawking embraced his platform, using celebrity to advocate for science, disability rights, and human potential.</p>

          <div class="detailed-info">
            <p><b>Deep Dive:</b> By 2009, Hawking could communicate only through a single cheek muscle controlling his computer. Yet he continued lecturing, writing, and inspiring. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recognized not just his scientific achievements, but his role as a symbol of human perseverance.</p>
            <p>President Obama praised him: "From his wheelchair, he's led us on a journey to the farthest and strangest reaches of the cosmos...He has expanded our knowledge of the universe and shown that there are no boundaries to the human spirit."</p>
            <p>Despite his physical limitations, Hawking maintained a full schedule: giving lectures via video link, collaborating with researchers worldwide, and working on new theories about the universe's origins and the nature of reality itself.</p>
