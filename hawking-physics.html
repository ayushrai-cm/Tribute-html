      <h3>Hawking Radiation</h3>
      <blockquote class="theory-quote">
        "Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought."
      </blockquote>
      
      <h4>The Discovery:</h4>
      <p>In 1974, Stephen Hawking made one of the most revolutionary discoveries in theoretical physics: black holes are not completely black. They emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon.</p>
      
      <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantum Fluctuations:</strong> Virtual particle-antiparticle pairs constantly appear near the event horizon</li>
        <li><strong>Particle Escape:</strong> One particle falls into the black hole while the other escapes as radiation</li>
        <li><strong>Black Hole Evaporation:</strong> Over immense time scales, black holes lose mass and eventually evaporate completely</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Smaller black holes are hotter and evaporate faster</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="code-block">
        <h4>Hawking Temperature Formula:</h4>
        <div class="formula">T = ℏc³ / (8πGMk)</div>
        <div class="explanation">
          Where:<br>
          T = Temperature of black hole<br>
          ℏ = Reduced Planck's constant<br>
          c = Speed of light<br>
          G = Gravitational constant<br>
          M = Mass of black hole<br>
          k = Boltzmann constant
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Impact:</h4>
      <p>Hawking radiation unified quantum mechanics, general relativity, and thermodynamics - three major pillars of physics. It showed that black holes have entropy and temperature, fundamentally changing our understanding of these cosmic objects.</p>

      <h3>Singularity Theorems</h3>
      <blockquote class="theory-quote">
        "The boundary conditions of the universe… must be that it has no boundary."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Working with mathematician Roger Penrose in the 1960s-70s, Hawking proved that singularities - points of infinite density - are inevitable consequences of general relativity under certain conditions.</p>
      
      <h4>Key Results:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Penrose-Hawking Theorems:</strong> Showed that singularities must exist in collapsing stars and the Big Bang</li>
        <li><strong>Trapped Surfaces:</strong> Once formed, certain regions of spacetime cannot escape gravitational collapse</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Censorship:</strong> Singularities are always hidden behind event horizons</li>
        <li><strong>Big Bang Origin:</strong> The universe began from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Philosophical Implications:</h4>
      <p>These theorems proved that the universe had a definite beginning, connecting physics with philosophical questions about creation and the nature of time itself.</p>

      <h3>Black Hole Thermodynamics</h3>
      <p>Hawking contributed to the four laws of black hole thermodynamics, paralleling classical thermodynamics:</p>
      
      <h4>The Four Laws:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zeroth Law:</strong> Surface gravity is constant over the event horizon (analogous to temperature)</li>
        <li><strong>First Law:</strong> Change in energy equals temperature times change in entropy plus other work terms</li>
        <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> The area of a black hole's event horizon never decreases (Hawking area theorem)</li>
        <li><strong>Third Law:</strong> Impossible to reduce surface gravity to zero in finite time</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-section">
      <h3>Information Paradox</h3>
      <p>Hawking radiation created a profound puzzle: if black holes evaporate completely, what happens to the information about the matter that fell in?</p>
      
      <h4>The Paradox:</h4>
      <p>Quantum mechanics says information cannot be destroyed, but Hawking radiation appears to be random thermal radiation containing no information about what fell into the black hole.</p>
      
      <h4>Hawking's Evolution:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1970s:</strong> Proposed information is lost</li>
        <li><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> Debated with other physicists</li>
        <li><strong>2004:</strong> Conceded information is preserved, though the mechanism remains unclear</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This paradox continues to drive research in quantum gravity and string theory today.</p>
