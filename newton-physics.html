    <h2 class="section-title">Newton's Three Laws of Motion</h2>

    <div class="detail-section">
      <h3>First Law: Law of Inertia</h3>
      <blockquote class="law-quote">
        "Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon."
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Explanation:</h4>
      <p>An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This is the concept of inertia - the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
      
      <h4>Real-World Examples:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A book resting on a table will remain at rest until someone picks it up</li>
        <li>A hockey puck sliding on ice continues moving until friction stops it</li>
        <li>Passengers jerk forward when a car suddenly stops</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-section">
      <h3>Second Law: Force and Acceleration</h3>
      <blockquote class="law-quote">
        "The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed."
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="formula">F = ma</div>
        <div class="explanation">
          Where:<br>
          F = Force (Newtons)<br>
          m = Mass (kilograms)<br>
          a = Acceleration (meters per second squared)
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Explanation:</h4>
      <p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This means heavier objects require more force to achieve the same acceleration as lighter objects.</p>
      
      <h4>Real-World Examples:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pushing a shopping cart - easier when empty (less mass), harder when full (more mass)</li>
        <li>A baseball accelerates faster than a bowling ball when hit with the same force</li>
        <li>Rocket propulsion - thrust force creates acceleration</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-section">
      <h3>Third Law: Action and Reaction</h3>
      <blockquote class="law-quote">
        "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts."
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Explanation:</h4>
      <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.</p>
      
      <h4>Real-World Examples:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When you jump, your legs apply a force to the ground, and the ground applies an equal and opposite reaction force that propels you into the air</li>
        <li>A rocket's engines push exhaust gases downward, and the gases push the rocket upward</li>
        <li>When swimming, you push water backward, and water pushes you forward</li>
        <li>A gun recoils backward when firing a bullet forward</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-section">
      <h3>Universal Gravitation</h3>
      <blockquote class="law-quote">
        "Every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers."
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Mathematical Formula:</h4>
      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="formula">F = G(m₁m₂)/r²</div>
        <div class="explanation">
          Where:<br>
          F = Gravitational Force<br>
          G = Gravitational Constant (6.674×10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²)<br>
          m₁, m₂ = Masses of two objects<br>
          r = Distance between centers of masses
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Impact:</h4>
      <p>This law unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics, explaining both why apples fall from trees and why planets orbit the sun. It was the first theory to successfully describe gravitational interactions throughout the universe.</p>
